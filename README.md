## Splits

By default, the code will train a depth model using [Zhou's subset](https://github.com/tinghuiz/SfMLearner) of the standard Eigen split of KITTI, which is designed for monocular training.
You can also train a model using the new [benchmark split](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_prediction) 
or the [odometry split](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) by setting the `--split` flag.


## Custom dataset

1. Make a new dataloader class which inherits from 'MonoDataset' (example - KITTIDataset)
2. Make a train/test/validation splits in `splits/` folder for your custom dataset
3. change details in options.py and trainer.py
4. add the new dataloader class in __init__.py in `datasets/` folder


## Training

By default models and tensorboard event files are saved to `~/tmp/<model_name>`.
This can be changed with the `--log_dir` flag.


**Monocular training:**
```shell
python train.py --model_name mono_model
```

## GPUs

The code can only be run on a single GPU.
You can specify which GPU to use with the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable:
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python train.py --model_name mono_model
```

All our experiments were performed on a single NVIDIA Titan Xp.

| Stereo            | 6GB                     | 8 hours                     |
| Mono + Stereo     | 11GB                    | 15 hours                    |
